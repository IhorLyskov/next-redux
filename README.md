# Redux Toolkit TypeScript

This code shows how to integrate Next.js with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org).

The **Redux Toolkit** is a standardized way to write Redux logic (create actions and reducers, setup the store with some default middlewares like redux devtools extension). This example demonstrates each of these features with Next.js

## How to use

```bash
npx create-next-app  <directory> with-redux-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app <directory> with-redux-app
```
